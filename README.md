# Ridge Regression Project
This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning course for the Master's in Data Science for Economics. It focuses on implementing and analyzing the results of Ridge Regression applied to **'Spotify Tracks dataset'**, downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset).

## Description
The project involves the implementation of **Ridge Regression**, which is a Linear Regression technique that adds a penalty to the coefficients to prevent overfitting. The final project report, included in the 'report.pdf' file, provides a comprehensive overview of the methodologies used, results obtained, and conclusions drawn.

## Repository Contents
The repository contains the following files and folders:

- **'Ridge Regression Project.ipynb'**: The Jupyter notebook containing the entire project code, including the implementation of Ridge Regression and result analysis.
- **'report.pdf'**: The final project report, including a detailed description of the problem, methodology, results, and conclusions.
- **'Experimental projects guidelines.pdf'**: Guidelines provided for the experimental project.
- **'Dataset Description.pdf'**: Description of the variables in the dataset used.
- **'dataset.csv'**: The dataset used for analysis and modeling.
- **'images/'**: A folder containing the graphs generated during data analysis and saved directly from the Python code.

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter notebook and reproduce the project results, the following requirements are needed:

- Python or Jupyter Notebook, with this libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
